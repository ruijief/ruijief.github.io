Automerge is an efficient LiDAR data processing framework that quickly and accurately assembles large numbers of
map segments into a complete map, enabling autonomous mobile robots to communicate and coordinate their movements. I was mainly in charge of enhancing the performance of sequence matching and testing the spherical convolutional LiDAR features.
