Many biological multi-agent systems exhibit a mechanism for information exchange among individuals known as mechanical communication, which leads to the emergence of collective behavior within the group. Similarly, multi-agent groups of articulated robots in a shared environment can dynamically adjust their shape and movements, influencing each other's motion through the ambient media. Recognizing the potential significance of this mechanism, we would like to investigate and harness the power of mechanical communication in the control of multi-agent locomotive systems.
