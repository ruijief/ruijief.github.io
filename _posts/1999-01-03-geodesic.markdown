Similar to the definition of topological complexity, geodesic complexity is a property that encodes the minimum number of continuous path planning rules needed to describe the geodesic between robot system's starting configuration and ending configuration in a space. It is invariant under isometries. We find a metric space that potentially has higher geodesic complexity than topological complexity, and study it by using the stratification method as given in the background paper above.
